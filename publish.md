[b]Intro[/b]  
Pain Magnet is a structure that draws the aggro of nearby monsters, effectively serving as a player shield.  
It is especially useful for solo players, particularly when playing as Walter.

[b]Usage[/b]  
[list]
[*] Unlocked via the [i]Science Machine[/i]. Use 5 Nightmare Fuel to build.
[*] Pain Magnet (PM) will attract all monsters within a configurable range: [b]15[/b], [b]25[/b], or [b]35[/b] units.  
[*] The initial health of the PM can be set in the configuration. Available options are: [b]3,000[/b], [b]10,000[/b], [b]30,000[/b], [b]50,000[/b], and [b]100,000[/b].  
[*] [i]Food Heal Ratio[/i] is a multiplier that determines how much health the PM restores when food is placed in its container.
      - The food’s Hunger value is multiplied by this ratio and converted into health.  
[*] PM can deal damage to monsters it attracts at frequency. You can set this value to: [b]0[/b], [b]10[/b], or [b]20[/b].
      - Note: The frequency is very fast, so I recommend adjusting it to 0

[i]Note: PM currently cannot attract the aggro of shadow creatures.[/i]
[i]Note: Pain Magnet is in an early experimental stage and may contain bugs.[/i]

[b]用法[/b]  
[list]
[*] 一本科技解锁[/i]. 使用 5 个恶魔燃料建造.
[*] PM 会吸引一定范围内的怪物仇恨，范围可以在设置中调整: [b]15[/b], [b]25[/b], or [b]35[/b] units.  
[*] PM的初始血量可以在设置中调整. 有四个选项可用 [b]3,000[/b], [b]10,000[/b], [b]30,000[/b], [b]50,000[/b], and [b]100,000[/b].  
[*] [i]Food Heal Ratio[/i] 的意思是，当你将食物放入到 PM 中它会将其食物的饱食度转换成 PM 的血量
      - 默认转换率 1 3 5 10 25 
[*] PM 会以一定频率对范围内的怪物造成伤害，伤害值选项： [b]0[/b], [b]10[/b], or [b]20[/b]
      - 注意 频率很高，所以我推荐设置成 0
