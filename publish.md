[b]Intro[/b]  
Pain Magnet is a structure that draws the aggro of nearby monsters, effectively serving as a player shield.  
It is especially useful for solo players, particularly when playing as Walter.

[b]Usage[/b]  
[list]
[*] Unlocked via the [i]Science Machine[/i].  
[*] Pain Magnet (PM) will attract all monsters within a configurable range: [b]15[/b], [b]25[/b], or [b]35[/b] units.  
[*] The initial health of the PM can be set in the configuration. Available options are: [b]3,000[/b], [b]10,000[/b], [b]30,000[/b], [b]50,000[/b], and [b]100,000[/b].  
[*] [i]Food Heal Ratio[/i] is a multiplier that determines how much health the PM restores when food is placed in its container.
      - The foodâ€™s Hunger value is multiplied by this ratio and converted into health.  
[*] PM can deal damage to monsters it attracts. You can set this value to: [b]0[/b], [b]10[/b], or [b]20[/b].
